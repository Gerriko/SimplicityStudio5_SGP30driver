# SimplicityStudio5_SGP30driver
This is a Gecko 3.2 based library for the Sensirion SGP30 Air Quality Sensor. This code is based on the Sparkfun SGP30 library for Arduino IDE. https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_SGP30_Arduino_Library

Tested on the Silicon Labs BGM220 Explorer Kit with the USART example. The wrappers are for the Air Quality 4 click. Please note that the wrapper includes printf statements, which are not required for the library to function correctly. Suggest removing.

A complete Simplicity Studio 5 project (in export format) is included. This contains a more up compatible library for SS5.
